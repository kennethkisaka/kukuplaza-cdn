<h3 class="subtitle">Ingredients:</h3>
<ul class="ingredient-list">

  <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
  <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
  <li>1 large lemon, zested and quartered</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, chopped</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme, chopped</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped</li>
  <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
  <li>1 cup chicken broth or water</li>
  <li>Extra fresh herbs and lemon slices for garnish (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="subtitle">Instructions:</h2>
<div class="section instructions">
  <ol class="instruction-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 190°C (375°F). Place a rack in the center of the oven.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Prepare the Chicken:</strong> Pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Rub olive oil all over the chicken, including the cavity. Season generously with salt, black pepper, and paprika.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Stuff the Chicken:</strong> Stuff the cavity with the quartered lemon and a few sprigs of fresh herbs (rosemary, thyme, parsley).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Make the Herb Mixture:</strong> In a small bowl, combine the minced garlic, lemon zest, chopped rosemary, thyme, and parsley. Rub this herb mixture all over the chicken, especially under the skin for extra flavor.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Roast the Chicken:</strong> Place the chicken, breast-side up, in a roasting pan. Pour 1 cup of chicken broth or water into the pan to keep the chicken moist. Roast for about 1 hour 20 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 75°C (165°F) and the skin is golden and crispy. Baste the chicken with the pan juices every 20-30 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rest the Chicken:</strong> Once the chicken is fully cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before carving. This helps the juices redistribute, making the meat more tender.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong> Garnish the roasted chicken with extra fresh herbs and lemon slices if desired. Serve with roasted vegetables, potatoes, or a side salad.
    </li>
  </ol>
