<div class="section instructions">
  <ol class="instruction-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until frothy. In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir until a dough forms.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 220°C (425°F). If you’re using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cook the Chicken:</strong> If your chicken isn't pre-cooked, sauté it in a pan with olive oil until fully cooked, then shred or dice it. Toss the cooked chicken with barbecue sauce and set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Assemble the Pizza:</strong> Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into two equal portions. Roll out one portion into a pizza shape on a floured surface. Transfer the dough to a pizza stone or a greased baking sheet.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Add the Toppings:</strong> Spread a thin layer of barbecue sauce over the pizza dough. Sprinkle mozzarella and cheddar cheese evenly over the sauce. Add the barbecue chicken on top and scatter the sliced red onions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong> Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and melted. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong> Once the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and garnish with freshly chopped cilantro if desired. Slice and serve hot!
    </li>
