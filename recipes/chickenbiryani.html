            <p style="margin-left: 0px">
              Biryani is a mixed rice dish, mainly popular in South Asia. It is
              made with rice, some type of meat and spices. To cater to
              vegetarians, in some cases, it is prepared by substituting
              vegetables or paneer for the meat. Sometimes eggs and/or potatoes
              are also added.

                <li>
                  <strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong> In a large bowl, mix
                  the yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric
                  powder, garam masala, lemon juice, and salt. Add the chicken
                  pieces to this mixture and marinate for at least 1 hour (or
                  overnight for better flavor).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cook the Rice:</strong> Boil 4 cups of water in a
                  large pot. Add bay leaves, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, and
                  salt. Once the water starts boiling, add the soaked basmati
                  rice and cook until the rice is about 70-80% cooked (it should
                  still be firm). Drain the rice and set it aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Prepare the Biryani Masala:</strong> In a large pan,
                  heat ghee or oil. Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle. Add
                  sliced onions and fry until golden brown. Add chopped tomatoes
                  and cook until soft and the oil starts separating. Add slit
                  green chilies, cilantro, mint leaves, biryani masala, and
                  garam masala. Stir well. Add the marinated chicken and cook
                  until the chicken is cooked through and the gravy thickens.
                  This may take 15-20 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Layering the Biryani:</strong> In a large,
                  heavy-bottomed pot, start layering the chicken and rice.
                  First, spread a layer of cooked chicken at the bottom, then
                  add a layer of rice. Sprinkle some saffron milk (or turmeric
                  water), chopped cilantro, and fried onions over the rice.
                  Repeat the layers until all the chicken and rice are used.
                  Finish with a final layer of rice on top and drizzle some ghee
                  and saffron milk.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Dum Cooking:</strong> Cover the pot tightly with a lid
                  or foil to trap the steam. You can seal the edges with dough
                  for better results. Cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes,
                  allowing the flavors to blend (this is called dum cooking).
                  Alternatively, you can bake the biryani at 180°C (350°F) for
                  20-25 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Serve:</strong> Once done, gently fluff the biryani
                  with a fork, mixing the layers. Garnish with boiled eggs and
                  more fried onions if desired. Serve with raita (yogurt sauce)
                  or salad on the side.
                </li>
