  <ol class="instruction-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Prepare the Chicken:</strong> Clean the Kienyeji chicken and cut it into manageable pieces. Place the pieces in a large pot, add water, and bring to a boil. Boil for about 30-45 minutes to tenderize the meat (Kienyeji chicken is tougher than regular chicken).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Saute the Vegetables:</strong> In a large pan or pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and saut√© until golden brown. Add the minced garlic and ginger, and cook for another 2 minutes until fragrant.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Add Tomatoes and Spices:</strong> Add the chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, and green bell pepper. Cook until the tomatoes soften and the mixture forms a thick sauce. Add the ground coriander, turmeric, cumin, curry powder, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine the spices.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Add Chicken and Vegetables:</strong> Add the boiled chicken pieces into the sauce. Add the chopped carrots, potatoes, and water or chicken broth. Stir everything together, cover the pot, and let it simmer on low heat for 20-30 minutes, or until the vegetables are cooked and the chicken is tender.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Finish and Garnish:</strong> Once the chicken is cooked through and the stew has thickened, sprinkle freshly chopped cilantro over the stew. Stir gently to mix.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the Kienyeji chicken stew hot with rice, ugali, or chapati. It also pairs well with a side of vegetables or kachumbari (tomato and onion salad).
