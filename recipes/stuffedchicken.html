  <ol class="instruction-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Prepare the Stuffing:</strong> In a bowl, mix together the chopped spinach, cream cheese, shredded cheese, and minced garlic. Season with salt and pepper.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Stuff the Chicken Breasts:</strong> Slice the chicken breasts horizontally to create a pocket. Be careful not to cut all the way through. Fill each pocket with the spinach-cheese mixture and secure with toothpicks. Season the stuffed chicken breasts with paprika, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cook the Chicken Breasts:</strong> In a pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Sear the stuffed chicken breasts for 3-4 minutes per side, until golden brown. Transfer to a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for 15-20 minutes to cook through. If you don’t want to bake, continue cooking in the pan on lower heat until the chicken is fully cooked.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Prepare the Chicken Stew:</strong> In a separate large pot, heat vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, sauté until softened. Add cumin, turmeric, and paprika, and stir for a minute. Add the chopped tomatoes and tomato paste. Cook until the tomatoes soften and the oil starts to separate.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Add Vegetables and Chicken:</strong> Add the carrots, potatoes, chicken thighs or drumsticks, and chicken broth to the pot. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 30-35 minutes, until the vegetables are tender and the chicken is fully cooked.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Serve:</strong> Once the stuffed chicken breasts are ready, serve them alongside the hearty chicken stew. Garnish with fresh parsley or cilantro.
